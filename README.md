# DesignARoom

## Description
DesignARoom is an AR application that allows you to detect vertical planes, change the color of the planes, and place objects by indicating the point on the planes where you want to insert them. It uses [AR Foundation 5.1](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/index.html).

This project primarily depends on two Unity packages:

* [AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/index.html)
* [Google ARCore XR Plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arcore@5.1/manual/index.html) on Android

## Main Features
- Real-time plane detection
- Placement of 3D objects on detected surfaces
- Object manipulation (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Intuitive user interface for selecting, managing and deleting objects
